          Ozanam Inn is a non-profit, direct service agency serving the homeless
          and underserved of Greater New Orleans, regardless of gender, race,
          color, creed, religious preference, or national origin. All of our
          services are provided free of charge. The Inn was established in 1955
          by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and is named in honor of
          Frederick Ozanam, who founded the Society in 1852.

          Ozanam Inn is currently equipped to sleep a minimum of 97 men and 59
          women per night. Overnight guests are given a bed for the night, a
          shower (toiletries and other necessities are provided), supper and
          breakfast, and are given clean pajamas in which to sleep. After the
          sale of the Camp St. location, in December of 2020, Ozanam Inn
          purchased a new and much larger building, at 2239 Poydras St., and we
          are now able to provide assistance to even more individuals in need.
          In our Poydras St. home, we are able to sleep 156 individuals
          including up to 59 beds dedicated for female guests. We are excited to
          be able to provide shelter for women for the first time in our
          history, as our old building did not have the space to facilitate
          women’s dormitories. For decades, we have provided paid-for vouchers
          to a nearby shelter so that our female clients had a clean and safe
          place to rest for the evening. Opening our doors to welcome females
          has been a dream for years and is now a reality.

          In addition to shelter and food, the Inn offers several other
          services. Ozanam Inn’s meal program is one of the most comprehensive
          in New Orleans, offering three meals a day, seven days a week. Anyone
          (men, women and children) may partake in our meal program and we serve
          an average of 400 - 500 meals each day. Clothing is offered to anyone
          in need with approximately 1,500 pieces of clothing distributed each
          month. Volunteer doctors and medical students perform basic healthcare
          services in-house and make referrals to area hospitals when necessary;
          they also offer several health screening such as TB tests, Hepatitis C
          tests and more. These services are provided through partnerships with
          LSU and Tulane Schools of Medicine and LSU School of Dentistry who
          hold a basic medical clinic on Saturdays and Sundays and is open to
          all. Additionally, anyone may use the Inn’s address to receive any and
          all types of mail, including important documents such as
          identification cards, social security cards, etc.

          Our case management team is on hand to help our clients who are
          struggling by, first, stabilizing their immediate crises and then
          working to understand the root causes of their homelessness. From
          there, we are able to connect them with the services and assistance
          they need to regain their health and independence.
