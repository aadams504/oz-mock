            At Ozanam Inn, our immediate priority is to offer aid and comfort to
            the poor and needy in our community by providing basic human needs
            such as; food, shelter, and clothing. While the foundation of our
            organizationâ€™s mission, it is only part of the work we do at Ozanam
            Inn. To end their suffering, we work with all individuals who come
            to us for assistance to move them from homelessness and hopelessness
            to independent living and a renewed feeling of HOPE. ALL services
            are free of charge and no one is turned away due to race, gender,
            creed, or social or political preferences.
